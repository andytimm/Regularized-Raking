	abstract = {Multilevel Regression and Poststratiﬁcation (MRP) has emerged as a widely-used technique for estimating subnational preferences from national polls. This technique, however, has a key limitation—existing MRP technology is best utilized for creating static as opposed to dynamic measures of opinion. We develop an approach for implementing a “dynamic MRP”, doing so in the context of changing public support for same-sex marriage. Using a large dataset of survey respondents, we estimate (in a single model) an annual measure of support for samesex marriage for each state from 1993 through 2004. To evaluate our estimates we examine their face validity and compare them to estimates produced using the standard MRP approach as well as to the estimates produced by actual state-level polls. We also consider the conditions under which dynamic MRP seems to produce more accurate estimates.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of assigning weights to a set of samples or data records, with the goal of achieving a representative weighting, which happens when certain sample averages of the data are close to prescribed values. We frame the problem of ﬁnding representative sample weights as an optimization problem, which in many cases is convex and can be efﬁciently solved. Our formulation includes as a special case the selection of a ﬁxed number of the samples, with equal weights, i.e., the problem of selecting a smaller representative subset of the samples. While this problem is combinatorial and not convex, heuristic methods based on convex optimization seem to perform very well. We describe our open-source implementation rsw and apply it to a skewed sample of the CDC BRFSS dataset.},

	abstract = {Abstract We propose the name generalized raking for the class of procedures developed in this article, because the classical raking ratio of W. E. Deming is a special case. Generalized raking can be used for estimation in surveys with auxiliary information in the form of known marginal counts in a frequency table in two or more dimensions. An important property of the generalized raking weights is that they reproduce the known marginal counts when applied to the categorical variables that define the frequency table. Our starting point is a class of distance measures and a set of original weights in the form of the standard sampling weights 1/π k , where π k is the inclusion probability of element k. New weights are derived by minimizing the total distance between original weights and new weights. The article makes contributions in three areas: (1) statistical inference conditionally on estimated cell counts, (2) simple calculation of variance estimates for the generalized raking estimators, and (3) presen...},

	abstract = {In the November 2016 U.S. presidential election, many state-level public opinion polls, particularly in the Upper Midwest, incorrectly predicted the winning candidate. One leading explanation for this polling miss is that the precipitous decline in traditional polling response rates led to greater reliance on statistical methods to adjust for the corresponding bias—and that these methods failed to adjust for important interactions between key variables like educational attainment, race, and geographic region. Finding calibration weights that account for important interactions remains challenging with traditional survey methods: raking typically balances the margins alone, while post-stratification, which exactly balances all interactions, is only feasible for a small number of variables. In this paper, we propose multilevel calibration weighting, which enforces tight balance constraints for marginal balance and looser constraints for higher-order interactions. This incorporates some of the benefits of post-stratification while retaining the guarantees of raking. We then correct for the bias due to the relaxed constraints via a flexible outcome model; we call this approach “double regression with post-stratification.” We use these tools to re-assess a large-scale survey of voter intention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, finding meaningful gains from the proposed methods. The approach is available in the multical R package.},

	abstract = {Scientific fields operate within paradigms that define problems and solutions for a community of researchers. The dominant paradigm in polling centers on random sampling, which is unfortunate because random sampling is, for all practical purposes, dead. The pollsters who try to produce random samples fail because hardly anyone responds. And more and more pollsters do not even try. The field therefore has folded weighting-type adjustments into the paradigm, but this too is unfortunate because weighting works only if we assume away important threats to sampling validity, threats that loom particularly large in the growing nonprobability polling sector. This article argues that the polling field needs to move to a more general paradigm built around the equation that characterizes survey error for any sampling approach, including nonrandom samples. Moving to this new paradigm has two important benefits. First, this new paradigm elevates new insights, including the fact that survey error increases with population size when individuals’ decisions to respond are correlated with how they respond. This insight helps us understand how small sampling defects can metastasize into large survey errors. Second, the new paradigm points the field toward new methods that more directly identify and account for sampling defects in a nonrandom sampling environment. This article describes the intuition and potential power of these new tools, tools that are further elaborated in .},
